# Yes Bank Closing Stock Price Prediction

This repository contains a project aimed at predicting the closing stock prices of Yes Bank using various machine learning techniques, specifically focusing on regression models.

## Project Overview

In this project, we explore and analyze a dataset related to Yes Bank's closing stock prices. Using machine learning techniques, particularly regression, we aim to predict the closing stock prices. This project demonstrates the complete machine learning workflow, from data processing and exploratory data analysis (EDA) to regression model selection and evaluation.

## Project Structure

The project is structured as follows:

1. **Data Loading and Preprocessing**:
    - Loading the dataset and performing preprocessing tasks such as handling missing values and outliers, and scaling the data.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
    - Visualizing relationships and distributions within the data to gain insights.

3. **Regression**:
    - Applying the best-fit regression model to the data.

4. **Model Tuning**:
    - Fine-tuning the model to improve its accuracy and performance.

## Installation

To run the notebook and reproduce the results, you need to install the following dependencies:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib scikit-learn keras tensorflow
